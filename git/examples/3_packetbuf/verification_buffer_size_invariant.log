saw option -a
Spin Version 6.5.2 -- 21 June 2024
Valid Options are:
	-a,-l,-f  -> are disabled by -DSAFETY
	-A  ignore assert() violations
	-b  consider it an error to exceed the depth-limit
	-cN stop at Nth error (defaults to -c1)
	-D  print state tables in dot-format and stop
	-d  print state tables and stop
	-e  create trails for all errors
	-E  ignore invalid end states
	-hN use different hash-seed N:0..499 (defaults to -h0)
	-hash generate a random hash-polynomial for -h0 (see also -rhash)
	      using a seed set with -RSn (default 12345)
	-i  search for shortest path to error
	-I  like -i, but approximate and faster
	-J  reverse eval order of nested unlesses
	-mN max depth N steps (default=10k)
	-N cn -- use the claim named cn
	-Nn   -- use claim number n
	-n  no listing of unreached states
	-QN set time-limit on execution of N minutes
	-q  require empty chans in valid end states
	-r  read and execute trail - can add -v,-n,-PN,-g,-C
	-r trailfilename  read and execute trail in file
	-rN read and execute N-th error trail
	-C  read and execute trail - columnated output (can add -v,-n)
	-r -PN read and execute trail - restrict trail output to proc N
	-g  read and execute trail + msc gui support
	-S  silent replay: only user defined printfs show
	-RSn use randomization seed n
	-rhash use random hash-polynomial and randomly choose -p_rotateN, -p_permute, or p_reverse
	-T  create trail files in read-only mode
	-t_reverse  reverse order in which transitions are explored
	-tsuf replace .trail with .suf on trailfiles
	-V  print SPIN version number
	-v  verbose -- filenames in unreached state listing
	-wN hashtable of 2^N entries (defaults to -w24)
	-x  do not overwrite an existing trail file

	options -r, -C, -PN, -g, and -S can optionally be followed by
	a filename argument, as in '-r filename', naming the trailfile
